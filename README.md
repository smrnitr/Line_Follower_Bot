**Line follower robot** 

It is a type of autonomous robot designed to follow a path or track a line on the ground. These robots are equipped with self-made IR sensors, which can detect the contrast between the white and black surfaces. The primary objective of a line follower robot is to navigate and move along the path by adjusting its movements based on the feedback received from the sensors.
The working principle of a line follower robot involves using the sensor data to make decisions about the robot's movement. When the sensors detect the line, the robot adjusts its direction to stay on course. If the sensors detect a deviation from the line, the robot responds by making corrections to realign itself with the path.
